# Rock Paper Scissors

For access to the live web page, I used [GitHub Pages](https://sinahuss.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)  

I've created a Rock Paper Scissors game as an intro to JavaScript and the DOM. Below are my thoughts and list of points I've learned while completing this project.  

- I've had previous experience with programming through Java, so I knew the basics
- Using the DOM was something that was new to me, and it was interesting learning how to 
manipulate it and see the results on the webpage.
- "innerHTML" is better used to change the format of a page, but it should only be used
when user input is limited so as to prevent cross site scripting
 - "innerText" should be used in cases when text is the only thing you want to change
